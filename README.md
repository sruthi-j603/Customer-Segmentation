# Customer-Segmentation 

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so that companies can effectively and appropriately market to each group. This improves customer retention, company sales, and strategies.

# Problem Statement:
In this project, we are grouping customers based on their spending behavior and purchase patterns in a mall. We are using the k-means clustering algorithm for this purpose.

# K-Means Clustering Algorithm: 
It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs to only one group with similar properties.
